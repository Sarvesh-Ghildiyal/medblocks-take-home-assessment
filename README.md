# Medblocks Take-Home Assessment

This is a Vite-powered frontend application developed as part of a take-home assessment for Medblocks. The goal of this project is to create a lightweight, browser-based patient registration app using [Pglite](https://github.com/lvce-editor/pglite), a SQLite implementation for the browser.
